# Minet Language Overview
### General
Minet is a web scripting language with a focus on readability and conciseness without resorting to a a large number of operators and special characters. Minet is compiled to Javascript.

The core tenets guiding the syntax are as follows:
* There should be a single, clear way to do a task.
* An expression should read as a sentence.
* Keywords are preferred over operators if they are of similar length.
* Reducing typing time is important.
* Things that can be inferred by the compiler should be, unless it hampers readability.
* Special characters to help the compiler are a waste of typing time.
* Any place where you have to repeat a leading keyword should also allow an indented block.
* When switching a single statement to an indented block, you shouldn't have to rewrite the command itself.
